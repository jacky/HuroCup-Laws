\section{The All-Round Competition}
\label{sec:all-round} 

This section contains information about the all-round humanoid robot
competition as part of \HuroCup. The all-round competition is the most
important \HuroCup\ event as it tests the versatility of a humanoid
robot. 

The winner in the all-round competition is determined by the single
robot with the most points over all seven \HuroCup\ events: robot dash,
penalty kick, obstacle run, lift and carry, weight lifting, marathon,
and basketball.

\law[RD]{Number of Robots}

\begin{lawlist}[RD]
 \item A single robot competes in a match.
\end{lawlist}

\law[ALR]{The Players}

Please refer to the general \HuroCup\ laws for a description of
the players.

\begin{lawlist}[ALR]
  
\item A single robot has to perform all events to be eligible to
 compete in the all-round competition.
  
\item A team is not allowed to modify the robot in any way for the
 different events.

\item A team is allowed to repair their robot only after having
 received permission from the referee.
  
\end{lawlist}

\law[RD]{The Referee}

Please refer to the general \HuroCup\ laws for a description of
the referee.

\law[RD]{The Assistant Referee}

Please refer to the general \HuroCup\ laws for a description of
the assitant referee.

\law[ALR]{Game Play}

\begin{lawlist}[ALR]

\item The score of a robot in the all-round competition is the sum of
 all the robot's scores in the \HuroCup\ events.

\end{lawlist}

\law[ALR]{Method of Scoring}

\begin{lawlist}[ALR]

\item All robots that have not gained at least one point in any event
 are automatically awarded no rank and $0$ points.

\item The robot with the maximum sumary score over all \HuroCup\
 events is declared the winner and the other ranks are determined
 according on the summary score for the other robots.

\item In case of multiple robots with the same summary score, the
 robot maximum score of a robot in a single event is used as a tie
 breaker.

\item In case of multiple robots with the same summary score and the
 same maximum single event score, the score of the robot over a single
 event is used as a tie breaker. The order of events is lift and
 carry, obstacle run, penalty kick, basketball, weight lifting, and
 robot dash.

\item In contrast to the other \HuroCup\ events, there is only a
 single round in the all-round competition. 

\end{lawlist}
