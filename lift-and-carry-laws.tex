\section*{Latest Version of the Rules for \HuroCup}
\label{sec:updates}

The latest official version of the rules of the game for \HuroCup\ is
always available from the FIRA \HuroCup\ website (http://www.fira.net).

\section*{Changes to the Rules of \HuroCup\ Lift and Carry for \thisyear}

The game play has been changed to make it more flexible and more
challenging. The robot now has to start at a random position around
the field and then reach the highest point on the uneven field and
then leave the stepping field.

The size of the uneven field has been increased to 1.5m by 1.5m.

\newpage

\section{Lift and Carry}
\label{sec:lift-and-carry} 

The goal of this competition is to provide an event that requires
robots to use active balancing. The robots will be fitted with a small
basket. The robot must start at a random spot around the field and
then reach a specific location on the uneven field. Once the robot has
reached the target location it must then continue and leave again the
uneven field.

Once a robot has successfully completed a run, extra weight is added
to the robot and it has to complete another run from a different
random location.

The robot that can successfully carry the most weight is declared the
winner of the event.

\section{Laws of the Game: Lift and Carry Competition}
\label{sec:rules-lift-carry}

The following laws describe the specifics of the lift and carry
event. For general specifications relevant to all \HuroCup\ events
(e.g., robot dimensions, playing field and lighting, responsibility of
the referees) please refer to the general \HuroCup\ laws.

\law[LC]{The Field of Play}
\label{lc-field}

\begin{lawlist}[LC]

\item The dimensions of the playing field are at least 180cm by
  180cm.

\item An approximately 1.50m by 1.50m wide uneven terrain is placed
  within the playing field (See Fig.~\ref{fig:lift-and-carry-field}.

  \begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/lift-and-carry}
    \end{center}
    \caption{The field of play for the lift and carry competition. The
      task for the robot is to cross the uneven terrain repeatedly with
      increasing load.}
    \label{fig:lift-and-carry-field}
  \end{figure}

\item The uneven terrain consists of sheets of hard material such as
corrugated plastic, corrugated cardboard, or wood. 

\item The thickness of a single sheet is between 5mm to 10mm.

\item The uneven terrain is constructed by placing random cut-outs of
the sheets on top of each other. The cut-outs may contain holes.  The
exact shape of the uneven terrain is determined by the local
organizing chair.

\item The sheets are colour coded, that is sheets at different heights
have different colours as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:uneven-terrain}.

    \caption{A sample uneven terrain}
    \label{fig:uneven-terrain}
  \end{figure}

\end{lawlist}

\law[LC]{Number of Robots}

\begin{lawlist}[LC]
\item A single robot competes in a match.
\end{lawlist}

\law[LC]{The Players}

Please refer to the general \HuroCup\ laws for a description of
the players.

\law[LC]{The Referee}

Please refer to the general \HuroCup\ laws for a description of
the referee.

\law[LC]{The Assistant Referee}

Please refer to the general \HuroCup\ laws for a description of
the assitant referee.

\law[LC]{Game Play}

\begin{lawlist}[LC]

\item A single robot is designated the runner. All other robots
  must be outside of the playing field.

\item The only robot allowed to move during a run is the
  designated runner.

\item The runner must be fitted with a small basket or bucket (see
  Fig.~\ref{fig:robot-lift-and-carry-basket} for an example), which is
  able to hold as many batteries as the team wants the robot to carry.

  \begin{figure}

      \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \caption{A suitable basket for the lift and carry challenge on the
      right and suitable weights (Standard AA batteries) in front.
      Such a basket must be fitted to the robot before the lift and
      carry challenge. A standard 591ml soft drink bottle is shown for
      comparison. The basket in the picture was constructed by cutting
      the bottom off the soft drink bottle.}
    \label{fig:robot-lift-and-carry-basket}
  \end{figure}

\item The runner will be placed at a random location on the edge of
  the uneven terrain. 

\item At the beginning of the competition, the referee will place five
  weights in the basket attached to the robot.

\item The referee will signal the start of the competition by blowing
  the whistle.

\item After the referee gives the start signal, the robot must
  immediately step onto to the uneven terrain. Then it must reach the
  highest spot on the uneven terrain. The robot has reached that the
  highest spot if it touches the highest spot with both feet.

\item Once the robot has successfully reached the highest spot on the
  uneven terrain, it must then leave the uneven terrain. The robot has
  left the field if both feet touch the ground outside of the uneven
  terrain.

\item Once the robot leaves the field after having reached the highest
  spot, the referee will add five weights to the robot and another run
  will start from a random location selected by the referee.

\item A robot is not allowed to leave the uneven terrain without
  touching the highest spot first.

\item The robot is not allowed to fall during a trial. The only parts
  of the robot that are allowed to touch the ground are its feet.

\item Each robot may have at most one human handler associated with
  it.

\item \label{lc-handler5} The human handlers are not allowed to
  interfere in any way with other robots, the referee, or other human
  handlers.

\item \label{lc-handler6} A human handler may only enter the playing
  field or touch his/her robot with the permission of the referee.

\item The end of the competition is signaled by the referee by
  blowing the whistle a second time.
  The referee terminates the competition if
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the robot has left the uneven terrain with a maximum load,
  \item the robot was unable to reach the highest spot and then leave
    the field within 2 minutes,
  \item the robot does not immediately step on the uneven terrain at
      the start of the trial,
  \item the robot leaves the uneven terrain before reaching the
    highest spot,
  \end{itemize}

\item At the end of the run, another robot will be designated the
  runner.

\end{lawlist}

\law[LC]{Method of Scoring}

\begin{lawlist}[LC]
\item Any robot that has not reached the highest spot and left the
  uneven terrain at least once is automatically awarded $0$ rank.

\item Among the robots that have left the uneven terrain at least
  once, the robots are ranked (i.e., 1st place, 2nd place) based on
  the greater number of batteries carried.

\item In case of a tie, i.e., more than one robot having carried the
  same number of batteries, the robots will be ranked based on the
  total time required to complete the number of rounds. For example,
  given three robots that have carried five batteries each with the
  following times:

      \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{l|rrrrr|r|r|}
          \hline
          Robot & \multicolumn{5}{c}{Times} & Total Time & Rank \\
          \hline
          R1 & 30 & 0 & 120 & 110 & 10 & 270 & 3 \\
          R2 & 50 & 50 & 50 & 50 & 50 & 250 & 2 \\
          R3 & 100 & 0 & 0 & 100 & 20 & 220 & 1 \\
          \hline
        \end{tabular}
      \end{center}

  In this example, R3 will be ranked higher than R2, who will be
  ranked higher than R1.

\item The point allocation for robots is as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The first ranked robot is awarded $10$ points.
  \item The second ranked robot is awarded $8$ points.
  \item The third ranked robot is awarded $6$ points.
  \item The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh place robots are awarded
    $4$,$3$,$2$, and $1$ point respectively.  A summary of the point
    allocation for placings is shown in table~\ref{point-allocation}.

    \begin{table}
      \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{l|l}
          \hline
          Place & Points scored \\
          \hline
          1 (Winner) & 10 \\
          2          & 8 \\
          3          & 6 \\
          4          & 4 \\
          5          & 3 \\
          6          & 2 \\
          7          & 1 \\
          8, 9, ...  & 0 \\
          \hline
        \end{tabular}
      \end{center}
      \caption{Point allocation for placings in the \HuroCup\ events.}
      \label{point-allocation}
    \end{table}
  \end{itemize}

\item In case of a tie between $n$ robots with rank $k$, all robots
  will be awarded rank $k$ and receive the average of the scores for
  ranks $k$ to $k+n$.  For example, if the robots $A,B,C,D$ scored
  $10, 8, 8, 4$ points respectively, then robot $A$ will be declared
  the winner (1st place) and receive 10 points, both robots $B$ and
  $C$ will be declared 2nd place finishers and receive $(8+6)/2=7$,
  and robot $D$ will be declared the fourth place finisher and receive
  $4$ points.

\end{lawlist}

\begin{decisions}
\item For the \thisyear\ competition, the technical committee decided
  that in addition to the restrictions given above, the uneven terrain
  includes the following simplifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item The uneven terrain will only contain steps wich move one level
  up or down.
\item The minimum distance between edges of the sheets is 3 cm.
\end{itemize}
These additional constraints are targeted at simplifying the lift and
carry competition over uneven terrain.
