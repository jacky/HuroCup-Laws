\section*{Latest Version of the Rules for \HuroCup}
\label{sec:updates}

The latest official version of the rules of the game for \HuroCup\ is
always available from the FIRA \HuroCup\ website (http://www.fira.net).

\section{Penalty Kick}
\label{sec:penalty-kick}

In this challenge, the robot must approach and kick a ball positioned
somewhere in the ball area. A robot from a different team will act as
goal keeper during this event.

\section{Changes in the Laws of \HuroCup\ Penalty Kick for 2008}

There are no significant changes in the laws of the penalty kick event
between 2007 and 2008.

\section{Laws of the Game: Penalty Kick}
\label{sec:laws-penalty-kicks}

The following laws describe the specifics of the penalty kick event. For
general specifications relevant to all \HuroCup\ events (e.g., robot
dimensions, playing field and lighting, responsibility of the
referees) please refer to the general \HuroCup\ laws.

\law[PK]{The Field of Play}
\label{pk-field}

\begin{lawlist}[PK]

\item The dimensions of the playing field are at least 220cm by
  180 cm. 

\item One side of the playing field contains a goal. This side of the
  playing field shall be called the goal side. The opposite side of
  the playing field is called the empty side. The two other sides are
  called side lines.

    \caption{The field of play for penalty kicks}
    \label{fig:field-penalty}
  \end{figure}

\item The goal is 100cm wide and is placed on the goal side of the
  playing area with its center along the center line of the playing
  field.

\item The penalty mark is 75cm away from the goal line.

\item The penalty area is specified by the triangle that extends from
the penalty mark to the top left and top right corner points of the
goal area.

\end{lawlist}

\law[PK]{The Ball}

Please refer to the general \HuroCup\ soccer laws for a description of
the ball.

\law[PK]{Number of Robots}

\begin{lawlist}[PK]
\item A single robot competes in a match.
\end{lawlist}

\law[PK]{The Players}

Please refer to the general \HuroCup\ laws for a description of
the players.

\law[PK]{The Referee}

Please refer to the general \HuroCup\ laws for a description of
the referee.

\law[PK]{The Assistant Referee}

Please refer to the general \HuroCup\ laws for a description of
the assitant referee.
 
\law[PK]{Game Play}

\begin{lawlist}[PK]

\item One robot is designated the kicker, another robot is designated
the goal keeper. All other robots must be positioned behind the centre
line and must not interfere with the designated kicker or goal keeper
in any way.

\item The only robots allowed to move during a penalty kick are the
  designated kicker and goal keeper.

\item Each robot may have at most one human handler associated with
  it. 

\item \label{rd-handler1} The human handlers must not interfere in any
  way with other robots, the referee, or other human handlers.

\item \label{rd-handler2} A human handler may only enter the playing
  field or touch his/her robot with the permission of the referee.
  The kick will be declared invalid if the handler touches the robot.

\item The kicker robot must be at the start point at the beginning of
the competition. The start point for
  \begin{itemize}
  \item small robots is 15cm behind the penalty mark for small robots
    in the center of the playing field.
    \item large robots is 30cm behind the penalty mark for large
      robots in the center of the playing field.
    \end{itemize}

\item The designated goal keeper must be positioned so that a part of
 the robot touches the goal line at the start of the game.

\item The referee will place a ball at a random position inside of the
 penalty area. 

\item The designated kicker is not allowed to leave the playing field
 or enter the goal area.

\item The designated goal keeper is not allowed to leave the goal
area.

\item The designated goal keeper must remain in a standard walking
posture until the ball has been kicked.

\item Any infringements of the rules shall be dealt with according to
the general \HuroCup\ rules.

\item The penalty kick begins by the referee blowing a whistle.

\item The end of the penalty kick is signaled by the referee by
  blowing the whistle a second time.
  The referee terminates the penalty kick if
  \begin{itemize}
  \item a goal has been scored by the kicker,
  \item the ball moved outside of the playing field,
  \item a robot is immobilized by a technical defect,
  \item a robot leaves the playing field,
  \item the maximum duration of the competition (2 minutes) has elapsed.
  \item at least 1 minute has elapsed since the start of the
    competition and it is unlikely in the opinion of the referee that
    the kicker will score in the next minute,
  \end{itemize}

\item After the end of the penalty kick, the next robot is
  designated the kicker.

\item After all other players have played against a robot as goal keeper, a
new robot will be designated the goal keeper. 

\end{lawlist}

\law[PK]{Method of Scoring}
\label{penalty-scoring}

\begin{lawlist}[PK]

\item The number of rounds in the competition is dependent on the
  number of robots in the event. Each robot will take a penalty kick
  against all other robots and will play goal keeper against all other
  robots at least once. So, if there are five robots in the competition,
  each robot will take four penalty kicks and there will be 20 kicks in
  total. Each robot receives one point for each goal that was scored.

\item Any robot that has not scored a single goal is automatically
  awarded 0 rank.
\item Among the robots that have scored at least one goal, the robots
  are ranked (i.e., 1st place, 2nd place) based on the greater number
  of goals that the robot scored.

\item The point allocation for robots is as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The first ranked robot is awarded $10$ points.
  \item The second ranked robot is awarded $8$ points.
  \item The third ranked robot is awarded $6$ points.
  \item The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh place robots are awarded
    $4$,$3$,$2$, and $1$ point respectively.  A summary of the point
    allocation for placings is shown in table~\ref{point-allocation}.

    \begin{table}
      \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{l|l}
          \hline
          Place & Points scored \\
          \hline
          1 (Winner) & 10 \\
          2          & 8 \\
          3          & 6 \\
          4          & 4 \\
          5          & 3 \\
          6          & 2 \\
          7          & 1 \\
          8, 9, ...  & 0 \\
          \hline
        \end{tabular}
      \end{center}
      \caption{Point allocation for placings in the \HuroCup\ events.}
      \label{point-allocation}
    \end{table}
 \end{itemize}

\item In case of a tie between $n$ robots with rank $k$, all robots
 will be awarded rank $k$ and receive the average of the scores for
 ranks $k$ to $k+n$.  For example, if the robots $A,B,C,D$ scored $10,
 8, 8, 4$ goals respectively, then robot $A$ will be declared the
 winner (1st place) and receive 10 points, both robots $B$ and $C$
 will be declared 2nd place finishers and receive $(8+6)/2=7$, and
 robot $D$ will be declared the fourth place finisher and receive $4$
 points.

\end{lawlist}

\begin{decisions}
\item A robot may follow up on the ball, that is, should the first
  shot miss, but still be inside of the playing field, then the kicker
  can repeatedly approach the ball and kick toward the goal.
\item A robot may also re-approach the ball if it missed hitting the
  ball in the first attempt.
\item The goal keeper is not allowed to squat or try to block a large
  part of the goal until the ball has been kicked for the first
  time. 
\item During the time between the start of the penalty kick and the
  time that the ball has been kicked, the robot may move freely in the
  goal area as long as it remains in a standard walking posture.
\end{decisions}
